# Power-BI-project about health providers
## Introduction
This project is focused on health providers all over the world. There are 4 groups of providers:
* physicians
* dentists
* nurses and midwives
* pharmacists
Last page then shows the numbers concerning providers by continents.

### Physicians, dentists, nurses and midwives, pharmacists
In all of these pages the layout is the same. The space above the horizontal line shows the title and then on the right there are navigation buttons to other pages. 
Left of the vertical line we have slicers. There are two to make the navigation easier. The top one chooses the first letter of the country and the bottom one then offers list of countries starting with that letter. 
Right of the vertical line we have five vizualizations which are all needed to give us a full picture concerning the relevant provider. 
*The column chart shows a number of providers per 1000 inhabitants. In this way the number is comparable across the countries. 
*Further there is table showing the total number of providers in different years. 
*In order to put it into perspective another table shows population of the chosen country.
*Map helps us to navigate with less known countries.
*Card then shows them maximum value of relevant providers per 1000 inhabitans.
In this way we can get a good idea of not only of the recent situation concerning providers but also of the historical development in the country.
By holding CTRL while choosing countries we can easily compare different countries together.
